Really Rough idea here cause I'm not good at this bit

While not technically needed, Art and Icons are the default folders for well, art and icons.

CharacterSelect.html - The main thing. Reads from character.js

CharacterSelectBuilder.html - Can Add characters, and fill in infot. again reads from character.js, and has a copy code button for pasting over it. (Never really looked into or figured out how to get it to overwrite or download a new js file.)

charactersheets.thml - Mostly for convience. Throw it up somewhere accessible (Github.io works!) with character.js and put which specific characters you want to share, then send a link out. I presonally make a copy and rename it for which ever game I'm applying for.

I hope this little hyper fixation project helps some people out <3
